# Identifying Accessibility Barriers to Robotics Research

## Motivation
We spotlight the under-representation of individuals with physical motor impairments in the robotics field, as we tackle barriers which hinder participation and propose solutions to foster inclusion and empowerment in our research community.

## Poster
A poster detailing the barriers and proposed solutions was presented at the Robotics: Science and Systems 2023 workshop titled "Lowering Barriers for Robotics Research". Find a copy of the poster [here](rss_loweringbarriers_poster.pdf).
